# 1
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 5
# 8
# 13
# 21
# 34
# 55
#
# 2.* Implement generator for Fibonacci numbers
#
# 3. Write generator expression that returns square numbers of integers from 0 to 10
#
# 4. Create an interface for the Laptop with the next methods: Screen, Keyboard, Touchpad, WebCam, Ports, Dynamics
# and create an HPLaptop class by using your interface.
#
# 5. Create an abstract class for the Car with the next methods: drive, stop, open_door, close_door, turn_on_light,
# turn_off_light, enable_radio, disable_radio, where drive and stop will be predefined with some realization, all others
